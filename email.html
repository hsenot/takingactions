	<b><i>What happens to your contribution?</i></b>
	<br><br>
	Your contribution will be logged in our <i>Action Bank</i>, then form part of the material to be aggregated during the course of the <i>Taking Action(s)</i> exhibition. Each day, Lizzy Sampson and Herve Senot will work to explore the possibility of a cohesive meaning in the accumulation of contributions within the <i>Action Bank</i>. Your contribution will be on display within the gallery intermittently. An evolving workspace will allow for contributions to be displayed primarily in 2D form on the wall.
	<br><br>
	<b><i>Anonymity or credit?</i></b>
	<br><br>
 	We don't know who you are unless you tell us when submitting your contribution. You and your contribution can remain anonymous, however we are most happy to credit each contributor. If you wish to be credited, please include your name when emailing through your contribution.
	<br><br>

	Every contribution will inform our project and form part of <i>The Findings</i>, a publication which will be distributed to all contributors.
	<br><br>

	Thanks again - we very much look forward to your contribution.
	<br><br>
	Lizzy &amp; Herve<br>
